# Transcriptomic Taxonomy of Adult Mouse Visual Cortex

This repository houses data and analyses for a study on the adult mouse visual cortex, featuring RPKM values for 24,057 genes across 1,679 cells. It provides a comprehensive view of gene expression patterns and cell clustering within a detailed transcriptomic taxonomy.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes:
- **Gene Expression Data**: RPKM values for 24,057 genes.
- **Cell Data**: Details on 1,679 cells derived from the adult mouse visual cortex.
- **Cluster Information**: Classification of cells into clusters based on gene expression patterns.

The data was sourced from a study available on the Broad Institute's Single Cell Portal and is also accessible via Figshare.

## Included Code and Analysis

Included in this repository is the code for differential expression analysis using Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test for pairwise comparisons. The code and the results are provided in a condensed format in Excel files. This allows for an examination of the effects of data over-imputation by MAGIC and scPHENIX across different phenotypes, aiming to evaluate the performance of these imputation methods.
