# Transcriptomic Taxonomy of Adult Mouse Visual Cortex

This repository houses data and analyses for a study on the adult mouse visual cortex, featuring RPKM values for 24,057 genes across 1,679 cells. It provides a comprehensive view of gene expression patterns and cell clustering within a detailed transcriptomic taxonomy.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes:
- **Gene Expression Data**: RPKM values for 24,057 genes.
- **Cell Data**: Details on 1,679 cells derived from the adult mouse visual cortex.
- **Cluster Information**: Classification of cells into clusters based on gene expression patterns.

The data was sourced from a study available on the Broad Institute's Single Cell Portal and is also accessible via Figshare.
