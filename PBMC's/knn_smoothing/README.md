# KNN-Smoothing Data Directory

This directory contains files related to the KNN-Smoothing process applied to gene expression data. Below is a description of the files and the parameters used.

## Files

- `clusters.csv`: File containing information about the obtained clusters.
- `Gene_Count_per_Cell_NORM_PCA30_k40.csv`: Imputed matrix using PCA with 30 components and KNN with k=40.
- `Gene_Count_per_Cell_NORM_PCA30_k3.csv`: Imputed matrix using PCA with 30 components and KNN with k=3.
- `Gene_Count_per_Cell_NORM_PCA120_k15.csv`: Imputed matrix using PCA with 120 components and KNN with k=15.
- `Gene_Count_per_Cell_NORM_PCA30_k15.csv`: Imputed matrix using PCA with 30 components and KNN with k=15.
- `Gene_Count_per_Cell_NORM_PCA10_k15.csv`: Imputed matrix using PCA with 10 components and KNN with k=15.
- `Gene_Count_per_Cell_NORM.csv`: Normalized gene count per cell matrix without imputation.

## DOI

All the data and imputed matrices can be accessed via the following DOI: [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25962658.v1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25962658.v1).

## KNN-Smoothing Parameters

The KNN-Smoothing parameters used are specified in the following table:

| PCA Components | KNN (k) |
| --------------- | ------- |
| 30              | 40      |
| 30              | 3       |
