## PBMC Gene-Gene Interactions MAGIC scPHENIX AND Only UMAP Init for sc-PHENIX

The Jupyter notebook `PBMC gene gene interactions MAGIC scPHENIX AND only UMAP init for sc-PHENIX.ipynb` was used to generate the supplementary material for Section S4. This section contains various combinations of parameters for PCA, KNN, and t-SNE with different initializations including PCA, PCA-UMAP, and only UMAP.

### Content

- **Supplementary Section S4**: Detailed analysis and results using different parameter combinations for PCA, KNN, and t-SNE.
- **Initialization Methods**: Comparisons of PCA, PCA-UMAP, and only UMAP initializations.

This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different parameter settings and initialization methods on gene-gene interaction data.

## KNN-Smoothing Folder

This folder contains all the files related to the KNN-Smoothing process applied to gene expression data. The files included are imputed gene count matrices using different parameters of PCA components and KNN.

- Imputed matrices using various combinations of PCA components and KNN values.
- Cluster information file and non imputed matrix

The specific parameters and configurations used for the KNN-Smoothing process can be found in the detailed README within this folder.

### DOI

All the data and imputed matrices can be accessed via the following DOI: [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25962658.v1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25962658.v1).
